1) Expand the typicode_tests.smokeTests to test all resources
2) Build tests for nested resources and filtering
3) Parallelize the typicode_tests.smokeTests for speed
4) Create package for each resource and expand all ( typicode_tests.commentsTests, typicode_tests.postsTests) ect.
5) Create more scenatrio tests
6) Make it so tests run in order -> Smokes Tests, then others.
